    1. **Understanding the Data**
        - **Review Datasets**: Understand the structure of the datasets (Student, Company, Company Reqt Status) to identify which features might be useful for your analysis.
        - **Identify Target Variable**: Determine the target variable for your predictive analysis (e.g., Status of training requests or time taken for fulfillment).

    2. **Creating New Features**
        - **From Existing Features**:
            - **Date Features**: Extract components from date columns (e.g., StartDate, Expected Start Date) to create new features like:
                - Year, Month, Day of the start date.
                - Duration (e.g., calculated as the difference between Expected Start Date and the current date).
            - **Categorical Encoding**: Convert categorical variables into numerical representations using techniques such as:
                - **One-Hot Encoding**: For features like Technology, Company Type, and Course Enrolled.
                - **Label Encoding**: For ordinal features (if any).
            - **Interaction Features**: Create interaction terms that capture relationships between features (e.g., Work Experience * Course Enrolled to see how experience influences course choice).
            - **Domain-Specific Features**:
                - Experience Level: Categorize Work Experience into levels (e.g., Entry, Mid, Senior) to simplify analysis.
                - Resource Demand Index: Create an index that combines Resource Count, Duration, and Status to measure demand.
                - Demand Fulfillment Rate: Calculate the ratio of fulfilled requests to total requests over a specific period for each company.

    3. **Transforming Features**
        - **Normalization/Standardization**:
            - Normalize or standardize numerical features (e.g., Work Experience, Resource Count) to ensure they are on the same scale, which can improve model performance.
        - **Binning**: Convert continuous variables into discrete bins (e.g., age groups, ranges of Work Experience) to capture non-linear relationships.

    4. **Handling Missing Values**
        - **Imputation**: Fill in missing values using appropriate techniques:
            - Mean/Median imputation for numerical features.
            - Mode imputation for categorical features.
        - **Feature Creation**: Create a binary feature indicating whether a value was missing (e.g., Is_Contact_Number_Missing).

    5. **Feature Selection**
        - **Correlation Analysis**: Use correlation matrices to identify highly correlated features that might be redundant.
        - **Feature Importance**: Use techniques like Random Forests or gradient boosting to assess feature importance and select relevant features for modeling.
        - **Statistical Tests**: Conduct statistical tests (e.g., chi-squared test for categorical features) to evaluate the significance of features in relation to the target variable.
